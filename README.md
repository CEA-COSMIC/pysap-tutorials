This repository holds demos for examples from various pysap plugins.
Click on the [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/cea-cosmic/pysap-tutorials/master) to launch a binder.

Navigate into the respective directories and run the examples and see the results.

You dont really need any dependencies, things work on the fly directly, all you need is chrome or firefox to work with jupyter notebooks.

If there are any issues faced in any example, please feel free to open an issue and we will address it as soon as possible!
